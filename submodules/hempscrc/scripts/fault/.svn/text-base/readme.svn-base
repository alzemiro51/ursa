Proposed Design Flow

1) configure the hemps instance by describing the .hmp file
2) described the HeMPS application in C
3) test the application without faults
4) if the app is ok, then think about the fault scenarios
5) use an script to generate the fault scenarios. the file scripts/fault/1-fault.py is an example of fault scenario generation script
6) now use the scripts/fault/run-all script to generate hemps with the designed app, with the specified fault scenarios. This step will launch one simulation to each fault scenario. These simulation are executed in the grid, with SGE.
7) the script will generate log files at the home dir. run scripts/fault/check-log script to extract results from each fault scenario simulation
