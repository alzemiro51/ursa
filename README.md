# URSA

Welcome to Ursa's repository. Ursa is an environment for creating, building and fast simulating multiprocessed platforms. 

The following sections may serve you as tour on the projet. Note that the project is in constant evolution! So, feel free to contact us regarding the development of Ursa.

## The Anatomy of Project Ursa

Ursa is composed of the following modules:

a) A discrete event simulator, which is called "UDES" (means Ursa's Discrete Time Simulator). UDES is the software behind the simulation of platforms. More documentation on UDES will be added soon.

b) Platforms, which are made of peripherals, busses, processors and other hardware. We are currently wokring on integrating the HF-RISCV processor with the peripherals from the HEMPS project. More information on HF-RISCV and HEMPS projects can be found in the [external contribution]() section.

c) Software, which is loaded into processors;

### External contribution

- *HF-RISCV*. The hf-riscv processor is maintained by Sergio Johann (sjohann81). More information on his work can be found at [his repository](https://github.com/sjohann81/hf-risc).

- *HEMPS*. The HEMPS projects is maintened by the GAPH group. More information on their work can be found at [their website](http://www.inf.pucrs.br/hemps/getting_started.html).
