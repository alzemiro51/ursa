You can use Terminator to display a lot of terminals using the same window, which is useful for watching several log files during the simulation. The config file contains a layout for Terminator that splits the window in a 3x3 tile setup and display logs for the HFRiscV processor in each window. You can either install it manually or run the terminator.sh script. 

INSTALLING:
Option 1] Copy the lines that correspond to the LAYOUTNOC3X3 layout 
          into your configuration file, which should be at "~/.config/terminator/config"

Option 2] Replace your configuration file by the one provided
Option 3] Run the provided script. This script will do the replacing for you.


USAGE:
Once you have installed the config file, run terminator passing '-l LAYOUTNOC3X3' as parameter. Alternativelly, run the provided script.

REMARKS:
1) Do not run this script from inside terminator because terminator will start in the wrong directory. Use XTerm or any other terminal emulator.

2) The provided script will OVERWRITE your current configuration file. Save it somewhere else or manually add the provided layout.

TODOS:
1) Automatize this script to receive X/Y as parameter and display logs for different system sizes. You need to generate a new config file for each run as well.
